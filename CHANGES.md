# 0.18.0

* Allow `:replace` in ADDS friendly interface.
* `TaskWrap::INITIAL_wRAP_STATIC` is now `::INITIAL_TASK_WRAP`.
* Remove `TaskWrap::Extension::WrapStatic`. We only use `TaskWrap::Extension` now. Note that presently, you
  cannot add options to the `config` field anymore via an extension.
* Internals: we don't use `Compiler` in tests anymore as this is a concept moved to `trailblazer-workflow`.
* Remove `Trailblazer::Activity::TaskBuilder.Binary()` deprecation.`

# 0.17.0

* In `Extension#call`, remove the dependency to `Implementation::Task`. The logic only receives the actual circuit task.
* Remove deprecated `Extension()` interface.
* Remove `Trailblazer::Activity::Introspect::Graph`.

# 0.16.4

* Revert the static "fix" from 0.16.3 and make the compaction fix optional, as most Ruby versions
  are solving this problem natively. See here for details: https://dev.to/trailblazer/gc-compaction-behold-your-hash-keys-2ii1#quick-fix

# 0.16.3

* Fix a bug in Ruby 3.2: `NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil`. Thanks @tiagotex for finding the problem
  and solution. This bug only occurs when compacting the memory using GC, which is only introduced with Ruby 3.2.

# 0.16.2

* Allow passing custom `:flow_options` to `Testing#assert_invoke`.

# 0.16.1

* Allow overriding `Activity.call`.

# 0.16.0

* Remove `Activity#[]`. Please use `activity.to_h[:config]`.
* Change `Activity#to_h[:nodes]`. This is now a `Schema::Nodes` "hash" that is keyed by task that
  points to `Nodes::Attributes` data structures (a replacement for `Activity::NodeAttributes`).
  This decision reduces logic and improves performance: it turned out that most of the time an introspect
  lookup queries for a task, not ID.
* Introduce `Activity::Introspect.Nodes()` as a consistent and fast interface for introspection
  and remove `Activity::Introspect::TaskMap`.
* Remove `Activity::NodeAttributes`.
* Move `Introspect::Graph` to `trailblazer-developer`. It's a data structure very specific
  to rendering, which is not a part of pure runtime behavior. `Activity::Introspect.Graph()` is now deprecated.
* `TaskWrap.container_activity_for` now accepts `:id` for setting an ID for the containered activity to
anything other than `nil`.
* Re-add `:nodes` to the container activity hash as this provides a consistent way for treating all `Activity`s.
* Remove `Activity::Config`. This immutable hash interface was used in one place, only, and can easily
  be replaced with `config.merge()`.
* Add `Introspect::Render`. Please consider this private.

## Intermediate/Implementation

* Remove `Intermediate.call`, this is now done through `Intermediate::Compiler`.
* Introduce `Intermediate::Compiler` which is simplified and is 10% faster.
* A terminus ("end event") in `Schema::Intermediate` no longer has outputs but an empty array. The
  `stop_event: true` option is still required to mark the `TaskRef` as a terminus.
* `Schema::Intermediate` now keeps a map `{<terminus ID> => :semantic}` instead of the flat termini ID list and
  one default start event instead of an array. This looks as follows.

    ```ruby
    Schema::Intermediate.new(
      {
        # ...
        Intermediate::TaskRef("End.success", stop_event: true) => [Inter::Out(:success, nil)]
      },
      ["End.success"],
      [:a] # start
    ```

    Now becomes

    ```ruby
    Schema::Intermediate.new(
      {
        # ...
        Intermediate::TaskRef("End.success", stop_event: true) => []
      },
      {"End.success" => :success},
      :a # start
    ```
* In line with the change in `Intermediate`, the `Implemention` termini `Task`s now don't have outputs anymore.

    ```ruby
    implementation = {
      # ...
      "End.success" => Schema::Implementation::Task(Activity::End.new(semantic: :success), [], []) # No need for outputs here.
    }
    ```

# 0.15.1

* Introduce `Extension.WrapStatic()` as a consistent interface for creating wrap_static extensions
  exposing the friendly interface.
* Deprecate `Extension(merge: ...)` since we have `Extension.WrapStatic` now.
* Better deprecation warnings for extensions using `Insert` and not the friendly interface.

# 0.15.0

* Rename `Circuit::Run` to `Circuit::Runner` for consistency with `TaskWrap::Runner`.
* Add `:flat_activity` keyword argument to `Testing.nested_activity`, so you can inject any activity for `:D`.
  Also, allow to change `:D`'s ID with the `:d_id` option.
* Introduce `Deprecate.warn` to have consistent deprecation warnings across all gems.
* Introduce `Activity.call` as a top-level entry point and abstraction for `TaskWrap.invoke`.

## TaskWrap

* Remove the `:wrap_static` keyword argument for `TaskWrap.invoke` and replace it with `:container_activity`.
* Make `TaskWrap.initial_wrap_static` return `INITIAL_TASK_WRAP` instead of recompiling it for every `#invoke`.
* Introduce `TaskWrap.container_activity_for` to build "host activities" that are used to provide a wrap_static to
  the actually run activity. This is also used in the `Each()` macro and other places.
* Allow `append: nil` for friendly interface.

  ```ruby
  TaskWrap.Extension([method(:add_1), id: "user.add_1", append: nil])`.
  ```
  This appends the step to the end of the pipeline.

## Introspect

* Add `Introspect.find_path` to retrieve a `Graph::Node` and its hosting activity from a deeply nested graph.
  Note that this method is still considered private.
* Add `Introspect::TaskMap` as a slim interface for introspecting `Activity` instances. Note that `Graph` might get
  moved to `developer` as it is very specific to rendering circuits.

## TaskAdapter

* Rename `Activity::TaskBuilder.Binary()` to `Activity::Circuit::TaskAdapter.for_step()`. It returns a `TaskAdapter`
  instance, which is a bit more descriptive than a `Task` instance.
* Add `Circuit.Step(callable_with_step_interface)` which accepts a step-interface callable and, when called, returns
  its result and the `ctx`. This is great for deciders in macros where you don't want the step's result on the `ctx`.
* Add `TaskWrap::Pipeline::TaskBuilder`.

# 0.14.0

* Remove `Pipeline.insert_before` and friends. Pipeline is now altered using ADDS mechanics, just
  as we do it with the `Sequence` in the `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear` gem.
* `Pipeline::Merge` is now `TaskWrap::Extension`. The "pre-friendly interface" you used to leverage for creating
  taskWrap (tw) extensions is now deprecated and you will see warnings. See https://trailblazer.to/2.1/docs/activity.html#activity-taskwrap-extension
* Replace `TaskWrap::Extension()` with `TaskWrap::Extension.WrapStatic()` as a consistent interface for creating tW extensions at compile-time.
* Remove `Insert.find`.
* Rename `Activity::State::Config` to `Activity::Config`.
* Move `VariableMapping` to the `trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear` gem.
* Move `Pipeline.prepend` to the `trailblazer-activity-linear-dsl` gem.
* Add `Testing#assert_call` as a consistent test implementation. (0.14.0.beta2)

# 0.13.0

* Removed `TaskWrap::Inject::Defaults`. This is now implemented through `dsl`'s `:inject` option.
* Removed `TaskWrap::VariableMapping.Extension`.
* Renamed private `TaskWrap::VariableMapping.merge_for` to `.merge_instructions_for` as there's no {Merge} instance, yet.
* Extract invocation logic in `TaskBuilder::Task` into `Task#call_option`.
* Add `TaskWrap::Pipeline::prepend`.

# 0.12.2

* Use extracted `trailblazer-option`.

# 0.12.1

* Allow injecting `:wrap_static` into `TaskWrap.invoke`.

# 0.12.0

* Support for Ruby 3.0.

# 0.11.5

* Bug fix: `:output` filter from `TaskWrap::VariableMapping` wasn't returning the correct `flow_options`. If the wrapped task changed
  its `flow_options`, the original one was still returned from the taskWrap run, not the updated one.

# 0.11.4

* Introduce the `config_wrap:` option in `Intermediate.call(intermediate, implementation, config_merge: {})` to allow injecting data into the activity's `:config` field.

# 0.11.3

* Allow `Testing.def_task` & `Testing.def_tasks` to return custom signals

# 0.11.2

* Upgrading `trailblazer-context` version :drum:

# 0.11.1

* Internal warning fixes.

# 0.11.0

* Support for Ruby 2.7. Most warnings are gone.

# 0.10.1

* Update IllegalSignalError exception for more clarity

# 0.10.0

* Require `developer` >= 0.0.7.
* Move `Activity::Introspect` back to this very gem.
* This is hopefully the last release before 2.1.0. :trollface:

# 0.9.4

* Move some test helpers to `Activity::Testing` to export them to other gems
* Remove introspection modules, it'll also be part of the `Dev` tools now.
* Remove tracing modules, it'll be part of the `Dev` tools now.

# 0.9.3

Unreleased.

# 0.9.2

Unreleased.

# 0.9.1

* Use `context-0.9.1`.

# 0.9.0

* Change API of `Input`/`Output` filters. Instead of calling them with `original_ctx, circuit_options` they're now called with the complete (original!) circuit interface. This simplifies calling and provides all circuit arguments to the filter which can then filter-out what is not needed.
    * `:input` is now called with `((original_ctx, flow_options), circuit_options)`
    * `:output` is now called with `(new_ctx, (original_ctx, flow_options), circuit_options)`

# 0.8.4
* Update `Present` to render `Developer.wtf?` for given activity fearlessly

# 0.8.3

* Use `Context.for` to create contexts.

# 0.8.2

* Fix `Present` so it works with Ruby <= 2.3.

# 0.8.1

* Remove `hirb` gem dependency.

# 0.8.0

* Separate the [DSL](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-activity-dsl-linear) from the runtime code. The latter sits in this gem.
* Separate the runtime {Activity} from its compilation, which happens through {Intermediate} (the structure) and {Implementation} (the runtime implementation) now.
* Introduce {Pipeline} which is a simpler and much fast type of activity, mostly for the taskWrap.

# 0.7.2

* When recording DSL calls, use the `object_id` as key, so cloned methods are considered as different recordings.

# 0.7.1

* Alias `Trace.call` to `Trace.invoke` for consistency.
* Allow injecting your own stack into `Trace.invoke`. This enables us to provide tracing even when there's an exception (due to, well, mutability).
* Minor changes in `Trace::Present` so that "unfinished" stacks can also be rendered.
* `Trace::Present.tree` is now private and superseded by `Present.call`.

# 0.7.0

* Remove `DSL::Helper`, "helper" methods now sit directly in the `DSL` namespace.

# 0.6.2

* Allow all `Option` types for input/output.

# 0.6.1

* Make `:input` and `:output` standard options of the DSL to create variable mappings.

# 0.6.0

* The `:task` option in `Circuit::call` is now named `:start_task` for consistency.
* Removed the `:argumenter` option for `Activity::call`. Instead, an `Activity` passes itself via the `:activity` option.
* Removed the `:extension` option. Instead, any option from the DSL that `is_a?(DSL::Extension)` will be processed in `add_task!`.
* Replace argumenters with `TaskWrap::invoke`. This simplifies the whole `call` process, and moves all initialization of args to the top.
* Added `Introspect::Graph::find`.
* Removed `Introspect::Enumerator` in favor of the `Graph` API.

# 0.5.4

* Introducing `Introspect::Enumerator` and removing `Introspect.find`. `Enumerator` contains `Enumerable` and exposes all necessary utility methods.

# 0.5.3

* In Path(), allow referencing an existing task, instead of creating an end event.
    This avoids having to use two `Output() => ..` and is much cleaner.

    ```ruby
    Path( end_id: :find_model) do .. end
    ```

# 0.5.2

* In `Path()`, we removed the `#path` method in favor of a cleaner `task` DSL method. We now use the default plus_poles `success` and `failure` everywhere for consistency. This means that a `task` has two outputs, and if you referenced `Output(:success)`, that would be only one of them. We're planning to have `pass` back which has one `success` plus_pole, only. This change makes the DSL wiring behavior much more consistent.
* Changed `TaskBuilder::Builder.()` to a function `TaskBuilder::Builder()`.

# 0.5.1

* Include all end events without outgoing connections into `Activity.outputs`. In earlier versions, we were filtering out end events without incoming connections, which reduces the number of outputs, but might not represent the desired interface of an activity.
* Add `_end` to `Railway` and `FastTrack`.
* Move `Builder::FastTrack::PassFast` and `:::FailFast` to `Activity::FastTrack` since those are signals and unrelated to builders.

# 0.5.0

* Rename `Nested()` to `Subprocess` and move the original one to the `operation` gem.
* Add merging: `Activity.merge!` now allows to compose an activity by merging another.
* Enforce using `Output(..) => Track(:success)` instead of just the track color `:success`. This allow having IDs both symbols and strings.

# 0.4.3

* Make `:outputs` the canonical way to define outputs, and not `:plus_poles`. The latter is computed by the DSL if not passed.
* Allow injecting `inspect` implementations into `Introspect` methods.
* Add `Nested`.
* Add `TaskBuilder::Task#to_s`.

# 0.4.2

* `End` is not a `Struct` so we can maintain more state, and are immutable.

# 0.4.1

* Remove `decompose` and replace it with a better `to_h`.
* `End` doesn't have a redundant `@name` anymore but only a semantic.

# 0.4.0

* We now use the "Module Subclass" pattern, and activities aren't classes anymore but modules.

# 0.3.2

* In the `TaskWrap`, rename `:result_direction` to `:return_signal` and `:result_args` to `:return_args`,

# 0.3.1

* Allow passing a `:normalizer` to the DSL.
* Builders don't have to provide `keywords` as we can filter them automatically.

# 0.2.2

* Remove `Activity#end_events`.

# 0.2.1

* Restructure all `Wrap`-specific tasks.
* Remove `Hash::Immutable`, we will use the `hamster` gem instead.

# 0.2.0

* The `Activity#call` API is now

    ```ruby
    signal, options, _ignored_circuit_options = Activity.( options, **circuit_options )
    ```

    The third return value, which is typically the `circuit_options`, is _ignored_ and for all task calls in this `Activity`, an identical, unchangeable set of `circuit_options` is passed to. This dramatically reduces unintended behavior with the task_wrap, tracing, etc. and usually simplifies tasks.

    The new API allows using bare `Activity` instances as tasks without any clumsy nesting work, making nesting very simple.

    A typical task will look as follows.

    ```ruby
    ->( (options, flow_options), **circuit_args ) do
      [ signal, [options, flow_options], *this_will_be_ignored ]
    end
    ```

    A task can only emit a signal and "options" (whatever data structure that may be), and can *not* change the `circuit_options` which usually contain activity-wide "global" configuration.



# 0.1.6

* `Nested` now is `Subprocess` because it literally does nothing else but calling a _process_ (or activity).

# 0.1.5

# 0.1.4

* `Nested` now uses kw args for `start_at` and the new `call` option. The latter allows to set the called method on the nested activity, e.g. `__call`.

# 0.1.3

* Introduce `Activity#outputs` and ditch `#end_events`.

# 0.1.2

* Consistent return values for all graph operations: `node, edge`.
* `Edge` now always gets an id.
* `#connect_for!` always throws away the old edge, fixing a bug where graph and circuit would look different.
* Internal simplifications for `Graph` alteration methods.

# 0.1.1

* Fix loading order.

# 0.0.12

* In `Activity::Before`, allow specifying what predecessing tasks to connect to the new_task via the
`:predecessors` option, and without knowing the direction. This will be the new preferred style in `Trailblazer:::Sequence`
where we can always assume directions are limited to `Right` and `Left` (e.g., with nested activities, this changes to a
colorful selection of directions).

# 0.0.11

* Temporarily allow injecting a `to_hash` transformer into a `ContainerChain`. This allows to ignore
certain container types such as `Dry::Container` in the KW transformation. Note that this is a temp
fix and will be replaced with proper pattern matching.

# 0.0.10

* Introduce `Context::ContainerChain` to eventually replace the heavy-weight `Skill` object.
* Fix a bug in `Option` where wrong args were passed when used without `flow_options`.

# 0.0.9

* Fix `Context#[]`, it returned `nil` when it should return `false`.

# 0.0.8

* Make `Trailblazer::Option` and `Trailblazer::Option::KW` a mix of lambda and object so it's easily extendable.

# 0.0.7

* It is now `Trailblazer::Args`.

# 0.0.6

* `Wrapped` is now `Wrap`. Also, a consistent `Alterations` interface allows tweaking here.

# 0.0.5

* The `Wrapped::Runner` now applies `Alterations` to each task's `Circuit`. This means you can inject `:task_alterations` into `Circuit#call`, which will then be merged into the task's original circuit, and then run. While this might sound like crazy talk, this allows any kind of external injection (tracing, input/output contracts, step dependency injections, ...) for specific or all tasks of any circuit.

# 0.0.4

* Simpler tracing with `Stack`.
* Added `Context`.
* Simplified `Circuit#call`.

# 0.0.3

* Make the first argument to `#Activity` (`@name`) always a Hash where `:id` is a reserved key for the name of the circuit.

# 0.0.2

* Make `flow_options` an immutable data structure just as `options`. It now needs to be returned from a `#call`.

# 0.0.1

* First release into an unsuspecting world. 🚀
